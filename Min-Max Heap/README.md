# Min-Max Heap

Min-Max Heap -> a complete binary tree data structure which combines the usefulness of both a min-heap and a max-heap, that is, it provides constant time retrieval and logarithmic time removal of both the minimum and maximum elements in it. This makes the min-max heap a very useful data structure to implement double-ended priority queue.
